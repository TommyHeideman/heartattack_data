# heart attack data project
This dataset contains examination results of patients at a single point in time, with each row representing a unique patient. The dataset includes seven columns of information: age, sex, chest pain, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiogram, exercise history, and heart attack history.

The "age" column represents the age of the patient in years. The "sex" column indicates the gender of the patient, with 1 representing female and 0 representing male. The "chest pain" column describes the type of chest pain experienced by the patient, with values ranging from 0 (typical chest pain) to 3 (asymptomatic).

The "fasting blood sugar" column indicates the patient's fasting blood sugar level, with a value of 1 indicating high blood sugar and 0 indicating regular blood sugar. The "resting electrocardiogram" column represents the results of the patient's resting EKG, with values of 0, 1, and 2 indicating normal EKG, abnormality in the ST-T wave, and abnormality in the left ventricular, respectively.

The "exercise history" column describes whether the patient exercises regularly, with a value of 1 indicating regular exercise and 0 indicating no regular exercise. Finally, the "heart attack history" column indicates whether the patient has had a heart attack in the past, with a value of 1 representing a history of heart attack and 0 representing no history of heart attack.

This dataset can be useful for exploring the relationships between various factors and the occurrence of heart attacks. We hope that this dataset will inspire interesting analyses and insights!
